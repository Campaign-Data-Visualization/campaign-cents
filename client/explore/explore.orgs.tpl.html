    One of the most destructive ways the Koch brothers spread their ideals and infiltrate Washington’s political scene is through the use of Koch-funded think tanks, Astroturf agents (fake grassroots groups), and lobbyists. These organizations spend millions on ads that attack Democrats, Obamacare, policies that attempt to regulate the oil industry, and many other figures that pose a threat to their surreptitious political and economic domination. IFG has compiled a list of “ORGs to Watch,” which are organizations and groups that are backed by Koch cash and have a heavy influence in American politics to spread awareness of whose voices are actually being heard in our democracy.

    <b>Americans for Prosperity</b> was founded with the support of Charles and David Koch, and claims that they’re fighting for “<a href="http://americansforprosperity.org/">economic freedom, limited government and prosperity for all</a>,” while relying heavily on support from Koch &amp; Co. AFP disburses money to organizations and candidates that promote policies that predominantly benefit the minority of millionaires and billionaires like the Kochs and disenfranchise ordinary American citizens. AFP strongly opposes any legislation that recognizes climate change or attempts to regulate the oil and fossil fuel industries. The Washington Post has called AFP “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/06/19/americans-for-prosperity-is-americas-third-biggest-political-party/">America's third-largest political party</a>.”

    <b>Freedom Partners</b> has been described by Politico as “<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/behind-the-curtain-exclusive-the-koch-brothers-secret-bank-96669.html#ixzz2hj4y5I8o">the Koch brothers’ secret bank</a>” because they receive massive multi-million dollar funds from undisclosed donors and give equally enormous sums to other organizations and politicians that advance the Conservative agenda, even going to the extreme of fiscally supporting the Tea Party. It raised $256 million during the 2012 election cycle, and served as the $400 million Koch networks’ “de facto bank” by “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/koch-backed-political-network-built-to-shield-donors-raised-400-million-in-2012-elections/2014/01/05/9e7cfd9a-719b-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e_story.html">feeding money to groups downstream</a>.” In June 2014, Freedom Partners coordinated an event where there were over 300 people in attendance, all worth about a billion dollars each. In this three-day event, the Freedom Partners PAC was created, and they planned to spend up to<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/2014-elections-koch-brothers-super-pac-107926.html"> $290 million</a> in 2014 midterm elections.

    <b>American Legislative Exchange Council</b> (ALEC) is a lobbying group with close ties to Koch, and has been known to relentlessly dispute clean energy businesses and policies that support the evolution of solar and wind technologies. ALEC boasts anti-environmental efforts such as supporting the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and the movement toward more industry-friendly fracking rules, and opposing any EPA regulations relating to public health and working toward cleaner industries. The group neglects the well-being of the environment and the public in its effort to advance corporate interests.There has also been a claim that ALEC is writing our policies, so in Virginia, a group looked into the depth of ALEC’s influence. They found that many of the bills brought up in the state were similar and even in some cases, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/opinion/the-big-money-behind-state-laws.html">word for word</a>, to the model legislations ALEC had drafted.
