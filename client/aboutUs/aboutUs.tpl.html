      <h2>International Forum on Globalization Action Fund</h2>

<p>The International Forum on Globalization is a hub for a growing group of national grassroots networks working on national and international issues. In recent years IFG has furthered investigation of the increasing role wealth plays in democracy across the world, but particularly in the USA. International Forum on Globalization Action Fund aims to influence the upcoming 2014 and 2016 elections.</p>

<h2>MoveOn</h2> 
<p>MoveOn is a community of more than 8 million Americans from all walks of life who use innovative technology to lead, participate in, and win campaigns for progressive change.</p>
<p>For over 14 years, the MoveOn family of organizations have used online tools to lower the barriers to participation in our democracy, so real Americans have a voice in a political process where big money and corporate lobbyists wield too much influence. Increasingly, MoveOn members and progressives are stepping up as the leaders of their own campaigns for social change, using MoveOn’s cutting-edge technology, such as MoveOn Petitions, to tap into our collective people power by enlisting other MoveOn members’ support.</p>
