      <h1>The Kochs</h1>

      <h2>The Koch Brothers</h2>
<p>Globalization’s extreme concentration of financial wealth is enabling the political power of super-rich individuals to play an unprecedented role in driving policy decisions. Almost all democratic movements today see their proposals paralyzed by money corrupting politics. With wealthy donors increasingly influential, by far the biggest force financing today’s attacks against progressive policies are Charles and David Koch.
The Kochs quintupled their combined net worth in recent years, from $10B in 2005 to $50B in 2011, and now have reached over the $100B  mark. This number renders the Koch brothers the wealthiest people on the planet, surpassing even the infamous Microsoft magnate, Bill Gates. “Koch Cash” has since become the single biggest source of funding to fight collective bargaining, clean air, voters’ rights, women’s rights, and strong social safety nets, in almost all regulatory arenas.  After radicalizing the House of Representatives via their Tea Party’s takeover of one third of available seats during elections in 2010, the Kochs led a $1B blitz in 2012 to replace the President, seat several more Tea Party activists in the Senate, and seize swing states to gerrymander permanent hardliners.  With both the Citizens United and McCutcheon Supreme Court decisions, money in politics has even less regulation.</p>

<h2>The Kochtopus</h2>
<p>In order to counter the network of Koch funded organizations -  a complex machine we call the Kochtopus - we engage in constant rigorous research and reach out to leading progressive organizations to bring citizens critical information about the Koch’s spending, agenda, interests, and victims.
The growing network of Charles and David Koch has become anathema to democratic ideals by using the new paradigm that money equals speech to spread their free-market fundamentalism, to elect politicians that align themselves with laws and policies that enrich them, and to muddy the waters on debates about climate change and environmental regulation. Koch’s total control over Congress will worsen today’s record of economic inequality and accelerating pace of climate change. Furthermore, the Kochtopus also funds politicians that push for anti-worker, anti-women, anti-voter, and anti-progress ideas on the national stage while using reports produced by groups that are funded by the Kochs. The whole process is indicative of the larger problem of money in politics. We aim to call out their pro-wealthy, anti-progress candidates and ensure they are thrown out or never elected at all.</p>
