    <h3>International Forum on Globalization Action Fund</h3>

    <p>The International Forum on Globalization is a hub for a growing group of national grassroots networks working on national and international issues. In recent years IFG has furthered investigation of the increasing role wealth plays in democracy across the world, but particularly in the USA. International Forum on Globalization Action Fund aims to influence the upcoming 2014 and 2016 elections.</p>

    <h3>MoveOn</h3> 
    <p>MoveOn is a community of more than 8 million Americans from all walks of life who use innovative technology to lead, participate in, and win campaigns for progressive change.</p>
    <p>For over 14 years, the MoveOn family of organizations have used online tools to lower the barriers to participation in our democracy, so real Americans have a voice in a political process where big money and corporate lobbyists wield too much influence. Increasingly, MoveOn members and progressives are stepping up as the leaders of their own campaigns for social change, using MoveOn’s cutting-edge technology, such as MoveOn Petitions, to tap into our collective people power by enlisting other MoveOn members’ support.</p>

    <h3>About the Website</h3>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>

    <p>In order to most cogently assess the impact of the Koch brother’s financial spending, IFG has had to aggregate data from their myriad channels of funding. These middlemen, such as Americans for Prosperity and Club for Growth, receive massive amounts of funding from the Koch brothers and distribute it to candidates across the country. Often the money is passed through multiple organizations before it is finally spent on a candidate, so it is crucial to note the strength of each organization’s connection to the Kochs.</p>
    
    <p>Tier 1 organizations consist of:
      <ul class='bulleted'>
        <li>Koch-owned business, such as Koch Industries and Flint Hills resources</li>
        <li>Political organizations with very close ties to the Kochs, i.e. they founded the company or sit on the board. Examples include Americans for Prosperity and Club for Growth 
        <li>Koch-owned or founded think tanks, such as the Cato Institute. Not many donations from these are included in our data.</li>
        <li>Any organization to which the Koch brothers have donated over one million dollars since 2008</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Tier 2 organizations consist of:
      <ul class='bulleted'>
        <li>Any organization that receives considerable funding from the Koch brothers that totals less than one million dollars. Most of our data is Tier 2. These are organizations that promote political philosophies tangential or advantageous to the Koch strategy; for example, the National Right to Life foundations promote social conservative ideals, which mobilize the voting base that the Koch brothers need to push through their fiscally conservative legislation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Organizations included in the data have a verified connection to Koch interests by the Center for Responsive Politics, from whom we acquired the donation data, and by internal IFG investigation. KochTracker has the benefit of amalgamating individual donation data, PAC to candidate and committee records, 527 spending, and outside spending data to provide the clearest possible picture of the extent of the Koch brothers’ web of political finance.</p>
