      <h3>IFG Action Fund</h3>

      <p>IFG Action Fund, a 501(c)4 sister organization of the International Forum on Globalization (IFG), is a hub for a growing group of national grassroots networks with millions of voting members who are rapidly realizing that their opposition’s single largest source of funding is Koch Industries. According to Bloomberg Billionaires’ Index, Charles and David Koch share a combined net worth of $104 billion, much more than Gates ($84B), Adelson ($34B), Soros ($26B), or Steyer ($1.6B). Koch told 250 other ultra-conservative donors at their June 2014 secret strategy meeting that they plan to raise a record $500 million to seize the Senate. We cannot outspend Koch, so we must out-organize them. IFG Action aims to influence these upcoming elections, because Koch’s total control over Congress will worsen today’s record economic inequality and accelerating climate catastrophe, while undermining a broader democratic transition toward equity and ecological sustainability. Our unique role is to expose candidates’ Koch connections (their “Koch problem”) so that Americans can stop the world’s two biggest billionaires from effectively buying control of US Congress.</p>

      <h3>Idzea</h3>

      <p>Idzea is a California-based design company that transferred the website’s domain name to IFG Action Fund and creates t-shirt concepts largely inspired by climate change, big oil, sustainability, solar power, bees, Sarah Palin, the Koch brothers, politics, Citizens United, and the obscene amount of corrupting money in our elections. Idzea believes the humble t-shirt can be elevated into an agent of transformation and a powerful way to challenge conventional "wisdom" of business-as-usual. And that it can also be stylish and fashionable at the same time. Idzea believe that what you wear is who you are, and that these messages empower us to challenge the hugely unassailable corporate monster and to give us the impetus to create a better world. Idzea concepts and designs have more than 35 years of design and advertising experience. See more at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.idzea.com'>www.idzea.com</a>.
