      <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <div class='row'>
      <p>In order to most cogently assess the impact of the Koch brother’s financial spending, IFG has aggregated data from their myriad channels of funding. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Klq9s2hEhPlECHTD8TLTvtA8sk6HmgYn8IgBXr9MDF0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">See our breakdown of spending here.</a> These middlemen, such as Americans for Prosperity and Club for Growth, receive massive amounts of funding from the Koch brothers and distribute it to candidates across the country. Often the money is passed through multiple organizations before it is finally spent on a candidate, so it is crucial to note the strength of each organization’s connection to the Kochs, indicated by two tiers.</p>

      <p>Organizations that receive substantial funding from the Koch network are categorized as Tier 1; all other expenditures are Tier 2*. Substantial funding, for our purposes, is defined as either receiving a majority of funding from Koch-associations or receiving over one million dollars from the Koch foundations. Organizations that have received significant, but not substantial, funding from the Kochs are classified as Tier 2 organizations.</p>
      
      <h4>Tier 1 organizations criterea:</h4>
        <ul class='bulleted'>
          <li>Koch-owned business, such as Koch Industries and Flint Hills resources
          <li>Astroturf political organizations with very close ties to the Kochs, i.e. one of the brothers founded the company or sits on the board. Examples include Americans for Prosperity and Club for Growth.
          <li>Koch-owned or Koch-founded think tanks, such as the Cato Institute. Because research organizations seldom give funds to candidates or campaigns directly, not many donations from these organizations are included in our data.
          <li>Any organization to which the Koch brothers have donated over one million dollars since 2008.
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Tier 2 organizations criterea:</h4>
        <ul class='bulleted'>
          <li>Any organization that receives considerable funding from the Koch brothers that totals less than one million dollars. These are organizations that promote political philosophies tangential or advantageous to the Koch strategy; for example, the National Right to Life foundations promote social conservative ideals, which mobilize the voting base that the Koch brothers need to push through their legislation.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Included organizations have a verified connection to Koch interests as identified by the donation data gathered by the <a href='http://opensecrets.org/' target="_blank">Center for Responsive Politics</a> and by internal IFG investigation. KochTracker has the benefit of amalgamating individual donation data, PAC to candidate and committee records, 527 spending, and real-time outside spending data to provide the fullest possible picture of the extent of the Koch brothers’ web of political finance supporting candidates.</p>

      <p>Any money spent in support of a candidate &mdash; whether spent on media advertisements, campaign posters, flyers, stamps &mdash; is counted as part of that candidate’s total, while money spent on attack ads against the opposition is counted toward that candidate as well. For example, $5,000 spent against Kay Hagan would count as money spent for Thom Tillis.</p>

      <h3>Why don’t the numbers add up?</h3>
      <p>There are several reasons our projected spending does not match the amounts we have reported on this site. First, we could not possibly track all of the spending. The Koch web of influence is tangled for a reason-- and consequently, very difficult to unravel. Newly-registered organizations continually spring up with nothing but a P.O. Box on the record, producing and distributing thousands of dollars worth of ads. What we have collected here is a significant portion of it: the largest expenditures by the most well-known Koch subsidiaries. The Koch brothers have both the inclination for secrecy and the financial capital to keep their connections well hidden. The other gap results from primary race expenditures for a candidate who is no longer running for a seat. For example, <a href='http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Frealtime.influenceexplorer.com%2Foutside-spending%2F%23%3Fordering%3D-expenditure_amount%26candidate_state_checked%3DMS%26district_checked%3D1031%26candidate_id_checked%3DS8MS00055%26filer_committee_id_number%3DC00487470&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGn-u8vji9znwedTtgRabjgFuUkCw' target='_blank'>Club for Growth</a> alone spent $3,130,000 backing Mississippi Senate hopeful <a href='http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Frealtime.influenceexplorer.com%2Foutside-spending%2F%23%3Fordering%3D-expenditure_amount%26candidate_state_checked%3DMS%26district_checked%3D1031%26candidate_id_checked%3DS4MS00120%26filer_committee_id_number%3DC00487470&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEeMOoNHrz8AkbNEdWL_upbHJW0iQ' target='_blank'>Chris McDaniel</a>, who challenged Thad Cochran in the Republican primary. Because McDaniel lost and is no longer a current candidate, donations to his campaign will not appear on the site.</p>

      <p class='clearfix'>*Note: Koch donations to certain large organizations &mdash; the <a target='_blank' href='http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/nra-koch-brothers-karl-rove'>NRA</a>, the <a target='_blank' href='http://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/revealed-the-secret-koch-group-that-gave-conservatives-236-million-in-2012'>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> &mdash; have exceeded $2 million, and thus our Tier 1 threshold. However, since these organizations are comprised of so many donors, IFGAF has decided that the Kochs' influence on the group is better categorized as a Tier 2 organization.</p>
